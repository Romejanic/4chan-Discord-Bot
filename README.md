# Getting Started with Development
You will need
- NodeJS
- A Discord application token for a bot

To install the project,
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Romejanic/4chan-Discord-Bot.git
$ cd 4chan-Discord-Bot
$ npm install      # this will download the dependancies
$ npm start        # this will generate a config file
$ nano config.json # edit the config and add your token
$ npm start        # you can now run the bot
```

To run the bot asynchronously (without blocking the terminal), you can use
```shell
$ npm run start_async
```
