# Getting Started with Development
You will need
- NodeJS
- MySQL server
- A Discord application token for a bot

To install the project,
1) Use the [init.sql](init.sql) file to set up your database.
2) Run the following commands:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Romejanic/4chan-Discord-Bot.git
$ cd 4chan-Discord-Bot
$ npm install      # this will download the dependancies
$ npm start        # this will generate a config file
$ nano config.json # edit the config and add your token and db login
$ npm run dev      # you can now run the bot in dev mode
```

To run the bot asynchronously (without blocking the terminal), you can use
```shell
$ npm run async
```

To migrate the legacy `guild-config.json` to your MySQL database, run the migration tool through npm:
```shell
$ nano config.json # ensure your database login is correct
$ npm run migrate  # run the migration tool
```
